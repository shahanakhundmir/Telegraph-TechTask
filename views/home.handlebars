		STORIES This is the LONGEST TEXT EVER! I was inspired by the various other
		"longest texts ever" on the internet, and I wanted to make my own. So here
		it is! This is going to be a WORLD RECORD! This is actually my third attempt
		at doing this. The first time, I didn't save it. The second time, the
		Neocities editor crashed. Now I'm writing this in Notepad, then copying it
		into the Neocities editor instead of typing it directly in the Neocities
		editor to avoid crashing. It sucks that my past two attempts are gone now.
		Those actually got pretty long. Not the longest, but still pretty long. I
		hope this one won't get lost somehow. Anyways, let's talk about WAFFLES! I
		like waffles. Waffles are cool. Waffles is a funny word. There's a Teen
		Titans Go episode called "Waffles" where the word "Waffles" is said a
		hundred-something times. It's pretty annoying. There's also a Teen Titans Go
		episode about Pig Latin. Don't know what Pig Latin is? It's a language
